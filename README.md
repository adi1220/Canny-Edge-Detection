# Canny-Edge-Detection :
Canny Edge Detection is a popular edge detection algorithm. It was developed by John F. Canny in 1986.
- It is a multi-stage algorithm and we will go through each stages :
1. Noise Reduction
2. Finding Intensity Gradient of the Image
3. Non-maximum Suppression
4. Hysteresis Thresholding

## Function And Parameters :
for edge detection opencv's (cv2.Canny()) feature is used with parameters :
- gray image , 
- lower threshold , 
- upper threshold
